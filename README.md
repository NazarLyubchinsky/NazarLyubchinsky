  <p>üå± My interest in technology and software development has turned into a desire to specialize in user interface and application development. Front-end development has become my chosen field in IT, as I feel a great interest in the creative process of creating websites, developing user interfaces, and design.</p>
  <p>It is very important to me that every element of a website is not only functional, but also aesthetically appealing. I decided to choose IT STEP Academy because this school offers a comprehensive web development training program that covers not only theory but also practical skills. </p>
  <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks such as React. which allows me to create modern websites that work on any device. I have a strong interest in constantly improving my skills and abilities in front-end development.</p>
  <p>‚ö°I always strive to improve my skills and explore new technologies to become an expert in my field.</p>
